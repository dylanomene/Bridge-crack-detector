# Bridge Crack Detector

A convolutional neural network trained to classify images of bridge surfaces (Decks, Pavements, Walls) into **Cracked** and **Non-cracked** categories.

## 🧠 Model Details
- Model: CNN (Keras)
- Accuracy: ~76% on balanced dataset
- Dataset: Custom Kaggle dataset with 84k+ Non-cracked vs 8k+ Cracked
- Preprocessing: Augmentation, resizing, normalization
- Balanced using random undersampling
